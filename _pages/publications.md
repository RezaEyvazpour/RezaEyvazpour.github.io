# 2020
![image-left](/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned. There should be plenty of room above, below, and to the right of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that left side. I don’t care what the right aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.

## Image alignment

![image-left]({{ "/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**. There should be plenty of room above, below, and to the right of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that left side. I don't care what the right aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.



![image-right]({{ "/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.



![full]({{ "/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" | relative_url }})
{: .full}

The image above should extend outside of the parent container on right.
