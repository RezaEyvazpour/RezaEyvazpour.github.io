I am a third year Master’s student in Department of Electrical and computer engineering at Tabriz University. I have been working as a Master student at Digital Systems Laboratory under supervision of DR. Ghader Karimian Khosroshahi since November 2017. I devote most of my time to the Hardware Implementation of Camera Pose Estimation algorithm.

I received my Bachelor’s in Electronic Engineering from University of Bonab, Bonab, IRAN, where I worked under guidance of Dr. Fariborz Rahimi on studying techniques to assessment of spasticity. I worked also as a Teacher Assistant.

## Research Interest   
My research interests include: Computer Vision, Signal Processing, Embedded Image Processing and Hardware Acceleration in Machine Vision and Machine Learning.

My Main Topic are in the following fields:
* Hardware Implementation (FPGA-based Implementation) 
* Machine Vision, SLAM 
* Biomedical Signal Processing 
* Machine Learning, Deep learning
