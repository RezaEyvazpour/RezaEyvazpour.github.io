I am a third year Master’s student in Department of Electrical and computer engineering at Tabriz University. I have been working as a Master student at Digital Systems Laboratory under supervision of Dr. Ghader Karimian Khosroshahi since November 2017. I devote most of my time to the Hardware Implementation of Camera Pose Estimation(Visual Odometry) algorithm.
