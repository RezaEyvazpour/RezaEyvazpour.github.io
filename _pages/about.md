I am a second year Master’s student in Department of Electrical and computer engineering at Tabriz University. I have been working as a Master student at Digital Systems Laboratory under supervision of DR. Ghader Karimian Khosroshahi since November 2017. I devote most of my time to the Hardware Implementation of SLAM algorithm.

I received my Bachelor’s in Electronic Engineering from University of Bonab, Bonab, IRAN, where I worked under guidance of Dr. Fariborz Rahimi on studying techniques to assessment of spasticity. I worked also as a Teacher Assistant.

My research interests include Electronic Digital, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in Hardware implementation on FPGA . I am also interested in other related research to Biomedical engineering.
