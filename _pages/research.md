# Biosignal Processing and Neuroscience

We are interested in how brain activity changes when performing cognitive, motor and others tasks across the lifespan, in health and disease.
The multidisciplinary nature of our research utilizes a variety of techniques, including behavioral, neural, and computational approaches. We use electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique, to measure brain activity and understand how activity across brain regions changes with behavior. We also apply advanced computational techniques to large behavioral and EEG data sets to discover patterns of activity and associations between brain and behavior to understand how they are disrupted with aging and/or disease.

# Objective evaluation and Quantitative (sensor-based) analysis of movement

Movement makes life possible. It is critical for interacting with people and the environment that are required for activities of daily living. They allow us to learn motor skills, maintain motor skills, and become experts in movement.
